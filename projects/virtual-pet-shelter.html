		<h2>Virtual Pet Shelter</h2>
		<p>
			The logical continuation of the Virtual Pet project, in which you find yourself operating Max and Riley's Shelter for Abandoned and Feral Pet Rocks. Adopt and care for as many pet rocks as you want, but each will need to be fed, watered, and played with or else they will crumble to dust. What will you feed your rocks? Will they grow happy enough to get loving families to adopt them?
		</p>

			Java, Test-Driven Design and Unity Tests, Collections, Pair Programming
