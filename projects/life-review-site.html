		<h2>Greg's Whole Life, Reviewed</h2>
		<p>
			An expanded form of the sweater review website, in which Greg's friend reviews Greg's whole life. From judging his choice in degree and house to picking his favorite of Greg's children, this website has it all. Greg's friend has picked up a few CSS skills and experience with databases, and made this website much more stylish and efficient.
