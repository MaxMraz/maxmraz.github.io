		<h2>Virtual Pet</h2>
		<p>
			A tomagachi-like console program, wherein the user finds a small robot and must take care of it. Teach it about the world and try to get on its good side before it becomes self-aware and causes the singularity. Take your robot on adventures such as trips to the grocery store or the park. Plant flowers together. Teach your robot not to hack the FBI's mainframe.
