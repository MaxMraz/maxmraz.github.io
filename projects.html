					<h2>Greg's Sweaters, Reviewed</h2>
					<p>
						A school project to make a review website. In this case, a website created to review the sweater collection of someone's friend. As you scroll through the sometimes-harsh reviews of an oft-mocked collection of sweaters, you realize the depts of the friendship between Greg and the writer.

					<h2>Greg's Whole Life, Reviewed</h2>
					<p>
						An expanded form of the sweater review website, in which Greg's friend reviews Greg's whole life. From judging his choice in degree and house to picking his favorite of Greg's children, this website has it all. Greg's friend has picked up a few CSS skills and experience with databases, and made this website much more stylish and efficient.

					<h2>Virtual Pet Shelter</h2>
					<p>
						The logical continuation of the Virtual Pet project, in which you find yourself operating Max and Riley's Shelter for Abandoned and Feral Pet Rocks. Adopt and care for as many pet rocks as you want, but each will need to be fed, watered, and played with or else they will crumble to dust. What will you feed your rocks? Will they grow happy enough to get loving families to adopt them?
